# Protect Our Planet
Protect Our Planet is an interactive quiz aimed at 8-12 year old children, with the aim of engaging positively about environmental topics in a fun way. Climate change is something we cannot shy away from and it is important that our children understand how to look after their planet. This quiz aims to introduce topics such as recycling, renewable energy, water efficiency and sustainable transport in an easily digestable and fun way, with the hope of inspiring and empowering young people to take action.

## Deployment

The following steps were followed to deploy the project to a live website in GitHub, using Github Pages:

- Ensure changes have been added and commited in Gitpod and pushed to GitHub.

- On the left of the page, under Options, scroll down until you get to Pages and click on Pages.
- Under Source, in the first box called "None", click the dropdown and select "master".
- Then select Save.
- The page will refresh and you will see a link above the Save button. This is the link to the live site. Note that it may take a few minutes for the site to be deployed.
- There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version of this project.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
The repository can be forked on GitHub, this creates a copy of the repository that can be viewed or amended without affecting the original repository. This can be done using the following steps:

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- At the top right of the repository (under your avatar) locate the Fork button and click this button.
- There should now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can amend.
