# Protect Our Planet
Protect Our Planet is an interactive quiz aimed at 8-12 year old children, with the aim of engaging positively about environmental topics in a fun way. Climate change is something we cannot shy away from and it is important that our children understand how to look after their planet. This quiz aims to introduce topics such as recycling, renewable energy, water efficiency and sustainable transport in an easily digestable and fun way, with the hope of inspiring and empowering young people to take action.
