The following steps were followed to deploy the project to a live website in GitHub, using Github Pages:

- Ensure changes have been added and commited in Gitpod and pushed to GitHub.

- On the left of the page, under Options, scroll down until you get to Pages and click on Pages.
- Under Source, in the first box called "None", click the dropdown and select "master".
- Then select Save.
- The page will refresh and you will see a link above the Save button. This is the link to the live site. Note that it may take a few minutes for the site to be deployed.
- There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version of this project.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
